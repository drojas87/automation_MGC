# automation_ruby
test


NOTE : This is an example using classes and pageObjects , it is based ( with many modifications) in a challenge that I did for a "X" Company so I continued
this excersice with the idea of showing a litte bit of my knowledge on automation + ruby + oop + pageObjects.
Design patterns were applied considering that I had to show my specific knowledge on those topics to the company X . I would probably don't use pageObjects
with ruby, example : I want to enter to wikipedia, I don't see the advantage on creating a wikiPedia page class , I would directly search for the link and click it.
